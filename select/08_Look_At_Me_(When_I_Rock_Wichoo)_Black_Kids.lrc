[00:31.54] Over and over, baby
[00:35.39] Making me play this game
[00:38.66] If true love waits, it's a big mistake
[00:42.42] No need to feel ashamed
[00:53.92] 
[00:46.13] When the clock says stop,
[00:48.34] We're all gonna drop
[00:49.22] I don't care if we get caught
[00:50.43] When the clock says stop,
[00:51.96] We're all gonna drop,
[00:53.48] I don't care what you've been taught
[00:55.83] I say "baby", you say "bump it"
[00:57.27] All you wanna hear is Gabriel's trumpet
[00:58.41] When the clock says stop,
[00:59.86] We're all gonna drop
[01:01.19] All gonna drop
[01:01.74] All gonna drop
[01:08.74] 
[01:02.29] If half of what they say is true
[01:03.97] Look at me when I rock with you
[01:07.59] If half of what they say is true
[01:11.21] Look at me when I rock with you
[01:15.28] Sure, I know it's apocalypse
[01:19.84] But can't it wait til I kiss your lips?
[01:24.61] If half of what they say is true
[01:26.69] Look at me when I rock with you
[01:42.19] 
[01:30.22] Baby...
[01:33.72] 
[01:34.59] You make me feel so helplesss
[01:39.08] I meet you after school
[01:42.74] I'm so tired of kissing,
[01:45.30] Shooting and missing
[01:47.07] Making me feel a fool
[01:57.57] 
[01:50.21] When the clock says stop,
[01:52.61] We're all gonna drop
[01:53.44] I don't care if we get caught

[02:08.49] You're gettin' off on kingdom come
[02:11.67] Well, if the Lord take you tonight
[02:15.94] C'mon girl, you best treat me right
[02:19.45] But I don't believe in happenstance
[02:23.67] So you're gonna give me your last dance
[02:43.17] 
[02:29.47] If half of what they say is true
[02:31.59] Look at me when I rock with you
