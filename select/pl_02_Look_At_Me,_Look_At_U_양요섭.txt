LOOK AT ME
TELL ME WHAT U C
THE BACK & 4TH OF AN EARTHQUAKE
OR A STRONG & STURDY TREE
EYE ASK MYSELF THIS QUESTION
BUT IT'S STILL A MYSTERY
HOW AM EYE GONNA
KEEP MY BALANCE WHEN EYE
LOOK AT U
HOW CAN U NOT KNOW
STANDING OVER THERE LIKE A NEFERTITI
OR THE QUEEN DIDO
PLEASE DON'T THINK 2 ILL OF ME
BUT IT'S ALL THAT EYE CAN DO
NOT 2 FEEL MYSELF
WHEN EYE LOOK AT U
MODESTY ASIDE
WHOEVER MADE YA SHOULD B PRAISED
AIN'T NO NEED 2 HIDE
EVERY GLASS SHOULD B RAISED
BRANDY OR MARTINI
KUDOS OVERDUE
WHAT ELSE IS THERE, REALLY
WHEN EYE
LOOK AT U
FIGHT IT YES - MY SOUL HAS TRIED
BUT WHEN U LOOK AT ME
ALL THE OTHER WOMEN JUST ROLL THEIR EYES
BUT EVEN RAY CHARLES CAN C
STEVIE WONDER CAN 2
THOUGHTS WELL UP & WONDER
THINKING ABOUT ME & U
A DOZEN FANTASIES
CALL ME "ONE & DONE" WHEN U
LOOK AT ME
